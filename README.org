#+TITLE: README

* Introduction

Solutions to the exercises from /The C Programming Language/ by Brian Kernighan
and Dennis Ritchie. I will include my own solutions as well as those the
solutions provided by the /The C Answer Book/ by Clovis L. Tondo.

I will try to provide a list of helpful resources at the the end of the README.

* Rules

+ Write in ANSI C (C89).
+ Be pedantic; turn on essentially all warnings
  #+begin_src sh
    cc -O0 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wformat=2 -Wunused-variable -Wno-implicit-int -Wno-return-type -pedantic
  #+end_src
+ For a given problem, use only techniques that have already been covered.
